# LycheeSlicerSettings

This repository is a way for me to contain the settings I ahve found work well for my Elegoo Saturn 3 12k.

None of these settings are suggested to be a panacea or fix for anyone else's printer or printing issues.

I only use Elegoo ABS-like v2.0 grey resin.  

I will fork this repo for any other resins I try or if I get another printer.
